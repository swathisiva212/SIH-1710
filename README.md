## Problem Title
SIH 1710: Enhancing Navigation for Railway Station Facilities and Locations

## Problem Description
Background: Railway stations are complex environments with numerous facilities and locations such as ticket counters, platforms, restrooms, food courts, and waiting areas. Passengers often face difficulties in navigating these spaces, especially in large or unfamiliar stations. Efficient and user-friendly navigation systems are crucial for improving passenger experience, reducing congestion, and ensuring timely travel connections. Description: The problem involves developing a comprehensive navigation solution for railway stations that assists passengers in locating various facilities and destinations within the station premises. This includes creating detailed maps, providing real-time directions, and integrating features such as accessibility options for individuals with disabilities. The solution should be intuitive, easy to use, and accessible via multiple platforms, including mobile devices and digital kiosks. Key challenges include updating navigation information in real-time, ensuring accuracy, and accommodating the diverse needs of all passengers. Expected Solution: The expected solution is a multi-platform navigation system that provides detailed, real-time directions to all facilities and locations within a railway station. This system should include: A mobile application with 3D interactive maps and step-by-step navigation. Digital kiosks located throughout the station with touch-screen interfaces. Voice-guided navigation for visually impaired passengers. Regular updates to reflect changes in station layout and facility locations. Integration with existing railway apps and services for seamless user experience. The solution should enhance the overall passenger experience by reducing confusion, saving time, and improving accessibility within the station.

## Expected Solution
The proposed solution is a multi-platform navigation system that includes:
A mobile application featuring 3D interactive maps and real-time route guidance.
Digital kiosks at key points in the station offering touchscreen-based navigation.
Voice-assisted navigation for visually impaired users.
Dynamic updates for station layout changes and shifting facility locations.
Integration with existing Indian Railways services for a unified experience.
The result should be reduced confusion, faster passenger flow, increased accessibility, and enhanced satisfaction across all types of users.

## Idea
1.Real-Time Station Navigation: Utilize AI-powered geolocation and mapping tools to guide users accurately to facilities like platforms, ticket counters, and restrooms.
2.Voice-Guided Accessibility: Integrate text-to-speech and voice command interfaces to support differently-abled and elderly passengers.
3.Live Train & Platform Info: Provide live notifications about train schedules, platform assignments, and last-minute changes.
4.Feedback & Issue Reporting: Allow passengers to report facility issues, congestion, or errors in navigation to improve system accuracy.
5.Integration with Rail Services: Sync the system with ticket booking, emergency support, and station authority tools for an all-in-one travel solution.
